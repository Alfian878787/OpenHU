# OpenHU Project

The OpenHU Project is a continuation of the original project "Headunit for Android Autoâ„¢" - originally created by Mike Reid.

We cannot thank Mike Reid enough for his contributions to the community. His departure cannot be overstated to this effort. Console, Inc. is continuing development - consistent with our wishes and communication with him prior to his passing.

The OpenHU Project (short for Open Head Unit) is an app that will bring Android Auto head unit functionality to existing AOSP-based devices.

This application is offered without warranty. The maintainers are not responsible for how you use it. Driving is your responsibility, not ours. Always focus on driving, not a touchscreen.

This app has not been approved or endorsed by Google. It uses open standards that underpin the Android Auto protocol. It requires an Android phone with the Android Auto application, available on the Google Play Store.
