# OpenHU Project

The OpenHU Project is a continuation of the original project "Headunit for Android Autoâ„¢" - originally created by Mike Reid.

We cannot thank Mike Reid enough for his contributions to the community. Mike's departure has been a massive setback for the Android Auto FOSS community. Console, Inc. is continuing development - something we discussed as an option in communication with him prior to his passing.

The OpenHU Project (short for Open Head Unit) is an app that will bring Android Auto head unit functionality to existing AOSP-based devices.

Currently OpenHU does not work with the latest Google Play Services (GMS) release. You must manually replace it with GMS 9.0 for this app's code to work. We are currently running a bounty to encourage the FOSS community to help us fix it: http://wiki.console.com.co/w/Console_Developer_Rewards

This application is offered without warranty. The maintainers are not responsible for how you use it. Driving is your responsibility, not ours. Always focus on driving, not a touchscreen.

This app has not been approved or endorsed by Google. It uses open standards that underpin the Android Auto protocol. It requires an Android phone with the Android Auto application, available on the Google Play Store.
